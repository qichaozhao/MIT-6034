# Problem 1.2: Multiple choice

# Which part of a rule may change the data?
#    1. the antecedent
#    2. the consequent
#    3. both

ANSWER_1 = '2'

# A rule-based system about Monty Python's "Dead Parrot" sketch
# uses the following rules:
#
# rule1 = IF( AND( '(?x) is a Norwegian Blue parrot',
#                  '(?x) is motionless' ),
#             THEN( '(?x) is not dead' ) )
#
# rule2 = IF( NOT( '(?x) is dead' ),
#             THEN( '(?x) is pining for the fjords' ) )
#
# and the following initial data:
#
# ( 'Polly is a Norwegian Blue parrot',
#   'Polly is motionless' )
#

# Will this system produce the datum 'Polly is pining for the
# fjords'?  Answer 'yes' or 'no'.
ANSWER_2 = 'no'

# Which rule contains a programming error? Answer '1' or '2'.
ANSWER_3 = '2'

# If you're uncertain of these answers, look in tests.py for an
# explanation.


# In a completely different scenario, suppose we have the
# following rules list:
#
# ( IF( AND( '(?x) has feathers',  # rule 1
#            '(?x) has a beak' ),
#       THEN( '(?x) is a bird' ),
#   IF( AND( '(?y) is a bird',     # rule 2
#            '(?y) cannot fly',
#            '(?y) can swim' ),
#       THEN( '(?y) is a penguin' ) ) )
#
# and the following list of initial data:
#
# ( 'Pendergast is a penguin',
#   'Pendergast has feathers',
#   'Pendergast has a beak',
#   'Pendergast cannot fly',
#   'Pendergast can swim' )
#
# In the following questions, answer '0' if neither rule does
# what is asked.  After we start the system running, which rule
# fires first?

# Which rule fires second?

# Problem 1.3.1: Poker hands

              'straight-flush beats full-house')

# Fill in this rule so that it finds all other combinations of
# which poker hands beat which, transitively. For example, it
# should be able to deduce that a three-of-a-kind beats a pair,
# because a three-of-a-kind beats two-pair, which beats a pair.

# these, so don't change them.
