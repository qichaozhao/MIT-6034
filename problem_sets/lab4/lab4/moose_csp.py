    # whether the value of the two variables have values O and B
    #
    # However the way our checker works, the constraint needs to be
    # expressed as a big AND.
    # So that when any one of the binary constraints
    # fails the entire assignment fails.

    # To turn our original OR formulation to an AND:
    # We invert the constraint condition as:

    #  for all sets of nonadjacent seats
    #     there must *not* exist a pair where O & B are assigned.

    # Here C checks whether the values assigned are O and B.
